World Structure Design for MUD

Tree Structure

Map navigation
  - Rooms without doors
  - Paths connecting locations
  - Buildings with multiple rooms
  - Flag for indoors vs outdoors
  - Flag for current weather conditions
  - Elevation levels (up/down)
  - Region boundaries

Zones
  - Hosted on unique servers for scalability
  - Different themes (forest, desert, dungeon, city, etc.)
  - Unique monster families per zone
  - Zone-level quests and storylines
  - Difficulty scaling based on player level
  - Resource nodes specific to each zone
  - Zone bosses and rare mob spawns

Connections
  - Description of the connection so the player doesn't walk down a staircase then turn around and climb up a ladder to the room they just came from
  - Connected to north, east, south, west rooms with directional descriptions
  - Up/Down connections with elevation descriptions
  - Portals between Zones (servers) with loading transitions
  - Conditions for traversal:
    - Pay life, mana, gold, or currency
    - Requires a key or specific item
    - Puzzle in room must be solved
    - Time-based restrictions (day/night gates)
    - Guild or faction requirements
    - Level or skill prerequisites
    - Quest completion requirements

Rooms
  - Loot system:
    - Pre-generated text descriptions for room features
    - Pre-generated art assets or ASCII art descriptions
    - Interactable objects (chests, levers, containers)
    - Environmental storytelling elements
  - Flags for special properties:
    - Safe zone (no PvP, no monster spawns)
    - No magic zone (spell casting disabled)
    - Dark area (reduced visibility, light source required)
    - Magical darkness (normal light sources don't work)
    - No recall zone (teleportation spells disabled)
    - Water breathing required
    - Gravity effects (slow fall, reverse gravity)
    - Time distortion fields
  - Room types:
    - Standard exploration rooms
    - Battle rooms for instanced combat
    - Puzzle rooms requiring solutions
    - Treasure rooms with valuable rewards
    - Trap rooms with hidden dangers
    - Rest areas with healing properties

Enemy Generation
  - Hard coded enemies to each room for consistency
  - Chance-based system for one enemy from a weighted list spawning
  - Time-based enemy respawns
  - Environmental triggers for enemy appearances
  - Dynamic difficulty scaling based on player count
  - Elite variants with special abilities
  - Rare mob spawns with unique loot tables
  - Territory behavior (enemies aggro in specific areas)
  - Day/night cycle affected spawns
  - Weather condition influenced enemy types

World Persistence
  - Persistent world state tracking
  - Dynamic events affecting multiple rooms/zones
  - Player-built structures and bases
  - Economy systems with trade routes
  - Faction influence on territory control
  - Seasonal changes affecting world layout
  - Server-wide events and celebrations
