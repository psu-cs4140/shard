Federated MUD-Specific Mechanics

Inter-Realm Travel: The core of a federated system.

    -Portals/Teleportation Circles: Require specific keys, spells, or quests to activate routes between worlds.
    -Astral Ships/Vessels: For sci-fi realms, a physical ship that players must crew to travel between planetary systems.
    -Planar Rifts: Temporary, unstable tears between worlds that offer high-risk, high-reward travel.

Cross-Realm Communication:

    -Sending Stones: Paired items that allow for limited long-distance communication.
    -Planar Messaging: A spell or tech that allows sending messages across realms for a high cost.
    Central Hub: A neutral, accessible realm (a city at the crossroads of reality, a space station) that serves as a meeting point.
    -Realm Attributes: Define each connected world.
    -Inherent Magic/Tech Level: Spells might fizzle in a high-tech world, and energy weapons might not recharge in a high-magic one.
    -Native Language: Players might need to learn "Elvish" or another to interact deeply with NPCs from that realm.
    -Environmental Effects: Simply being in a realm of fire might cause the "Overheated" effect without protection.
