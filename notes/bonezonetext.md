Darkness presses against your mind like a heavy shroud.
You awaken to the cold bite of stone beneath your back, the scent of decay thick in the air.
Dim torchlight flickers along the walls of a vast underground chamber — The Tomb, the heart of the Bone Zone.
 
Around you, the silence hums with unseen whispers… the restless murmur of those long dead_
 
A shape stirs in the shadows.
From the gloom steps a towering figure clad in tarnished armor, bone fragments etched into his pauldrons. His eyes burn with a faint, spectral light — neither alive nor dead.
 
The Tombguard raises his rusted halberd in salute.
He studies you for a long moment before speaking, his voice like gravel dragged across stone.
 
Tombguard:
“So… the slumbering soul has stirred at last. For ages, none have risen from these coffins — not since the Curse bled through the marrow of the realm. Yet here you stand, breathing where none should draw breath.”
 
“This place — the Bone Zone — is but the first of many blighted lands. The Curse festers across the realm, binding life and death in cruel accord. Beyond these crypts lie wastelands of ash, forests of marrow, and cities swallowed by shadow.”
 
“To denounce the Curse, you must travel across them all — face the remnants of those who fell before you, and seek the one who commands this decay. Only by striking down the source may the realm ever know rest.”
 
The Tombguard’s eyes gleam faintly through his helm, his voice lowering to a measured growl.
 
“If your mind falters from the long sleep, remember — your will shapes your path.
When you wish to commune, talk [npc name].
To seek guidance or purpose, quest [npc name].
To defend yourself, attack.
To take what the dead no longer need, pickup [item].
To see what burdens or blessings you carry, whisper inventory.”
 
He plants the butt of his halberd into the stone floor, the sound echoing like a drumbeat in the tomb.
 
“Before you face the Bone Zone beyond, you must arm yourself. A blade once rested beside your coffin — your blade — but the lesser dead have claimed it for themselves. They skulk in the lower chambers, drawn to its lingering power.”
 
The Tombguard steps aside, his gaze fixed upon you.
 
“Speak to me with the command "quest Tombguard", and I will mark the first step of your path: reclaim your sword from the tomb’s depths. Only then will your true journey begin.”
