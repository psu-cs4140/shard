# UI/UX Ideas:

## Health:
 
- Unique health visual (not simple bar). Example: Amnesia Dark Descent heart
visually takes looks worse as damage is taken, could be similar.
    
    - Note: Obviously a bit more work than a simple health bar, but could 
    still be a simple design.


## Stamina (?):

- Don't think it makes sense for this kind of game, think it should
just be actions.


## Magic (if it exists in the world): 

- Mana represented as a blue potion/flask? More fun than a bar

- Equipped spell could be displayed in spell slot in the same area weapon 
slots displayed.


### Ways to use magic:

- Scrolls: Found and purchased within the dungeon. Single use. No mana or 
stats necessary.

- Learned Spells: Can be used any time if have necessary mana.

- Ways to Obtain:

    - Starting class/race

    - Special room encounters in dungeon
   

## Weapon Slots:

- Represented visually in bottom left corner, simple box with the equipped
weapons / items in those boxes (think Elden Ring). Two boxes, maybe a third
to represent magic.

- Cycle between slots 1 an 2 with "Q". If nothing in slot, unarmed fists.

- No need for mouse, game should be playable 100% with keyboard.


## Interactive Mode:

- "T" Keypress to enter "MUD-like" text interaction mode

- User can type in action similar to Genesis MUD, hit "Enter" to execute

- Example: Open chest, examine wall, etc.


## Inventory:

- Very standard approach, press "I" to pull up inventory list. Could either 
be represented as a list or grid with slots. Doesn't need to be fancy.

- No equip load.

- Limited inventory count?


## Temperature:

- Can be damaged/debuffed by extreme temperatures

- Visually represented as a border effect.

    - Cold -> frost encroaches on screen starting from screen edges, slowly
    grows toward center of screen

    - Heat -> same deal but with a firey/burning effect

    - Damage taken over time in both instances, maybe slowing effect for 
    frost and 

- Obviously more work than a simple temperature guage/meter but more fun


## Food/Water:

- Unsure whether this should be included. If want survival elements, sure, 
otherwise food could simply be another means to restore health and whatever.


## Status Effects:

- Simple visual representation through icons with or without screen effects.

    - Once again think Elden Ring, simple icon under the health area that 
    represents the effect (green bubble for poison, armor chest piece with 
    arrow going up to represent armor up, etc.)

## General Look:

- Dark, simple aesthetics.
- As few meters and numbers on screen as possible

## Potential Keybinds: 

- All types of "movement": WASD and Arrow Keys
    - Movement between rooms-> W = Forward, A = Left, S = Back, D = Right
    - Same with target selection if multiple targets is a thing, or maybe 
    arrow keys for this
    - Arrow Keys for Menu and Inventory?

- Interactive Mode - "T"
    - Confirm with "Enter"

- Switch Weapon Slot - "Q"

- Use equipped spell - "F"

- Confirm - "E" or "Enter"
    - All types of confirmation like inventory item selection, target
    selection, etc.
    - Example: "Attack this target?"

- Map - "M"
    - Popup for full map, could have smaller map displayed constantly 
    in top right corner.

- Menu(?) Unsure if needed- "Esc"
    - Popup to adjust settings

- Access Spellbook - "Y" or something
    - UI popup listing equipped spell and available spells
    - Maybe scrolls are equipped in spell slots as well? Or could be
    a different way to use them
